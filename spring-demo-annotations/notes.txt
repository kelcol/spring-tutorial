FIELD INJECTION
java reflection - inject dependencies by setting field values on your class directly (even pvt fields)

1. Config DI with autowiring
	- applied directly to field
	- no need for setter methods
	
Three kinds of injection: constructor, setter, and field
	- choose a style and stay consistent!
